Comparative Protein Modelling 

BIO INFORMATICS project for modelling of protein sequences, a datascience-machine learning related class

This is my class project for Comparative Protein Modelling using Modeller 9.17

Every detail  was clearly explained as in the presentation, it includes all the steps necessary for execution and working of the protein modelling

I've used sequences from CASP 11 and CASP 10 for protein Modelling practice

Sequences are matched from BLAST and PDB databases and PDB files are downloaded from PDB website

and sequence files are downloaded from PDB website and query files from CASP 11 and CASP 10.

Results are verified from Swiss Model and Molprobity websites
